## Introduction
This is an implementation of a quantum autoencoder for image denoising. The autoencoder is trained on a set of images with added noise. The autoencoder is then used to denoise the same set of images.

### Autoencoder
There are 3 main components of the autoencoder:
- Encoder
- Latent space: The latent space is the space between the encoder and decoder. It is a compressed representation of the input image.
- Decoder

### Quantum Autoencoder
Due to the limitations of latent space in a classical autoencoder, a quantum approximate optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal latent space.
